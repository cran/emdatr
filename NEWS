* Data from EM-DAT was downloaded in early Nov 2013 and is not complete
  for 2013.

* `emdat_extract` can be used to extract data for a desired time period
  Selection by other criteria may be included in the future.
  
* `Location` variable from the EM-DAT database has `...` possibly 
  when there are too many locations and the web browser cannot display all 
  the locations. Raw data from EM-DAT has to be obtained to fix this problem.
