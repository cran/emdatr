Version 0.3, May 2015
-----------

* Data from EMDAT has been updated to include the whole of 2014 (latest 
  as of May 2015). GDP and population data has been updated, but 2014 data 
  is still not available from the World Bank. USA Consumer Price Index data 
  has been revised to include 2014 data.

* Previous versions of EMDAT involved significant cleanup of raw data from EMDAT 
  (such as country names and typos in Type/SubType of disasters). The latest 
  data from EMDAT does not have many of these issues.

* Vignette has been changed from a PDF to a markdown document.

* Changed License from GPL to MIT.
  
Version 0.2, May 2014
-----------

* Data from EMDAT has been updated to include the whole of 2013. GDP and 
  population data has been updated accordingly.

* The entire cleaned data is now hosted on bitbucket and the package
  comes only with a sample of the cleaned data. Data from bitbucket
  can now be obtained using the package via RCurl.
  
* Functionality provided by the package has been modified to be consistent
  with the above mentioned data changes. It is generally advised against the use 
  of `subset` and `sapply` commands, especially in package development.
  Hence, the code has been revised accordingly. 
  
* `emdat_extract` has been replaced with `extract_emdat`.

* `Year` variable in the cleaned data was found to have missing values due to 
  a bug in the cleaning process. This bug has been fixed. 

* Vignette has been added to demonstrate not only the use of the package 
  but also the replication of graphics presented in EMDAT's annual ADSR reports.
    
Version 0.1, Nov 2013
-----------

* Data from EM-DAT was downloaded in early Nov 2013 and is not complete
  for 2013.

* `emdat_extract` can be used to extract data for a desired time period
  Selection by other criteria may be included in the future.
  
* `Location` variable from the EM-DAT database has `...` possibly 
  when there are too many locations and the web browser cannot display all 
  the locations. Raw data from EM-DAT has to be obtained to fix this problem.
