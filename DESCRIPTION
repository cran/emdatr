Title: Global Disaster Losses from the EMDAT Database Using R
Description: The 'EMDAT' database provides information on human
    and financial losses from more than 21,000 major natural global
    disasters from 1900 to the present. This package provides the
    entire data available from 'EMDAT' and also additional relevant
    information such as historical national GDP and population.
    Moreover, this package also provides functionality to extract
    desired subsets of the 'EMDAT' data. The examples provided in
    the vignette demonstrate the functionality provided by 'emdatr'.
    The goal of 'emdatr' is to promote the use of 'EMDAT' data, bring
    transparency to the data, shed light on the limitations of
    the data, and make the analysis of the data easier using R.
