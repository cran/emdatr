Title: Global Disaster Losses from the EMDAT database Using R
Description: The EMDAT database provides valuable information on human
    and financial losses from natural disasters around the world. Some
    of the issues with the EMDAT data are lack of entire data
    accessibility, static and inconsistent summary reports, and the
    lack of auxiliary financial and demographic data. The emdatr
    package addresses some of these issues. Data from EMDAT was downloaded
    via the web (http://www.emdat.be/database) and cleaned and
    enhanced. emdatr provides a sample of this cleaned and
    enhanced data. Also, emdatr provides functionality to access
    the entire cleaned and enhanced EMDAT data. The examples provided in
    the vignette demonstrate the functionality provided by emdatr.
    The goal of emdatr is to promote the use of EMDAT data, bring
    transparency to the data, shed light on the limitations of the data,
    and make the analysis of the data easier through the R language and
    the plethora of open source packages built around it.
